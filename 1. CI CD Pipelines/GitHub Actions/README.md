/// GitHub Actions CI/CD /// 

This module demonstrates a working CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

What it does:
- Runs every time I push to the repo
- Checks out the repo
- Echoes a message to confirm it's working

Why it matters:
This is the base for adding security scans (Trivy, Snyk, etc.) into my DevSecOps flow.
